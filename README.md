BountyBG is a smart contract provides the facilities to post bounty projects and reward to users have done them.
Here the contract has been developed based on the BountyBG core contract provided by bountyone for the challenge offered by them. Here is the links of challenges:

https://github.com/BountyOneBounties/SmartContract/issues/2

Initialy the smart contract was created so as to only allow the owner of the contract to reward a bounty. Besides, it could only accept ETHER for payments.

Two challenges were offered to change the core contract in order to:

1- The address that posts the bounty is the one can reward the user.

2- The owner of the contract can also reward users if the bounty poster does not do so in a timely manner.

3- Accept any ERC20 token for payments.

4- "Reward" the paid ERC20 token for that particular bounty.

5- All functionality remaining the same except the token type.
